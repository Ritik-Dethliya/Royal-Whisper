## ðŸ“– About

Royal Whisper is a digital revival of one of Indiaâ€™s most beloved childhood board games â€” popularly known as "Raja-Mantri-Chor-Sipahi", "Char-Chit", or "Find the Thief". We've reimagined this classic for the modern screen, preserving the thrill, suspense, and joy that once echoed in every gully and classroom.

## Motivation & Vision
> The core idea emerged from observing how many elders often feel disconnected from todayâ€™s digital-first gaming culture. Royal Whisper is our attempt to give them a reason to smile, relive memories, and bond with younger generations â€” all while playing a game theyâ€™ve always loved.

Whether you're 8 or 80, the suspense of the thief, the power of the king, and the whisper of roles will pull you in.
